# VueJS Boilerplate Code base

## Context 

This is a VueJS 3 (JavaScript) boilerplate code base who implements a basic back-office web app component such as a Login and Sign up components, a reusable component to display data within a table or a fom component used to send data.

It also includes a ready to use web app Layout (back-office) with the default components (Sidebar, Navbar, Footer ...) that can be easily customisable as you want.

## Process ?

This boilerplate code base is used to speed up development process and help the user to focus on the big picture of his application rather than spending time on annoying and repetitive tasks.

A list of the implemented features: 

- UI Component:
    - Auth (Login, Sign up)
    - Basic Layout (Sidebar, Navbar, Footer ...)
    - Dyncamic reusable Table component
    - Dynamic resusable Form component

- Navigation with vue-router
- Styling with bootstrap
- Using JavaScript for now instead of TypeScript
